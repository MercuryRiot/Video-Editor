This worked with convert.exe (which is now discontinued) and was later updated to work with magick.exe as part of a seperate project to make use of its full capabilities.

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. Import necessary libraries:
   - `os`: for operating system-related functionality.
   - `moviepy.editor`: for video editing with MoviePy.
   - `IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY`: specifying the path to the ImageMagick binary.

2. Prompt the user for input:
   - `org_video_path`: Path to the original video.
   - `final_video_folder`: Path to the folder where the final video will be saved.
   - `final_video_name`: Name of the final video file (with the .mp4 extension).
   - `audio_path`: Path to the audio file.
   - `watermark`: Text to be used as a watermark.

3. Set the path for the final video by joining the output folder and file name.

4. Load the original video and audio clips.

5. Extract a portion of the audio clip from 25 to 40 seconds and save it as `final_audio`.

6. Define the width, height, and frames per second (fps) for the video clip.

7. Create an intro text clip with the text "Hello world" that is displayed for 5 seconds, centered in white text.

8. Set the duration and fps for the intro text, and position it in the center.

9. Extract a portion of the audio clip from 25 to 30 seconds for the intro music and set it as the audio for the intro text.

10. Create a watermark text clip with the specified watermark text, size, color, alignment, and size matching the video.

11. Set the fps and duration of the watermark text clip to match the video's duration.

12. Position the watermark at the bottom-right corner with specified margins and opacity.

13. Create a watermarked video clip by compositing the original video and the watermark text.

14. Set the fps and audio of the watermarked clip.

15. Create the final video by compositing the intro text (with the intro music) and the watermarked clip, adjusting their durations.

16. Write the final video to the specified path using the H.264 codec for video and AAC for audio.

Note: Make sure you have MoviePy and ImageMagick installed on your system for this script to work. You also need to provide the correct file paths and ensure that the necessary input files exist at the specified locations.
